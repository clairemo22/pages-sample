I'm currently a doctoral candidate in the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at CU Boulder. I was born in Santa Monica but grew up in Sacramento, California. My family spent much of our summers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan-- one of the best places in the US surrounded by the Great Lakes. For as long as I can remember I've been one of the biggest Michigan Wolverine fans, so I was ecstatic when I finally made the move to Ann Arbor for undergrad. I stayed for 5 years (two years post-undergrad working a research job in the Medical School). Most recently, I've moved to Boulder, Colorado to complete a PhD.
